5 devs were challenged to make a game with weird mechanics, using this art kit 
https://opengameart.org/content/1-bit-16x16-minimalist-art-pack (made by me)

My interpretation of the theme was the player being able to control time with their voice
(talking brings you to normal speed, and not talking brings you into slow motion)
I was pretty inspired by this video

I will be uploading a devlog here on my channel
